**Date and time** tools are relatively straight-forward, and include the following options:
- **Age** : difference between the current date and the date in each row
- **Date only** : removes the time component from a date/time field
- **Year/month/quarter/week/day** : extract individual components from a date field (time-specific options include Hour, Minutes, Seconds, etc)
- **Earliest/Lates** : evaluates the earliest or latest date from a column as a single value (can only be accessed from the "Transform" menu)

**Note** : you will almost always want to perform these operations from the "*Add column*" menu to build out new fields, rather than transforming an individual date/time column.

**PRO TIP** : Load up a table containing a **single date column** and use Date tools to build out an **entire calendar table**
