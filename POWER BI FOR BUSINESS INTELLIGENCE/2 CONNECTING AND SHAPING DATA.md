## GOALS FOR THIS SECTION

1. Explore Power BI's query editor to understand the role that Power Query plays in the larger BI workflow
2. Introduce different types of connectors and connectivity models avaiable for getting data into Power BI
3. Review tools for checking data quality and key profiling metrics like column distribution, empty values, errors, and outliers

5. Practive combinging, modifying, and refreshing queries.


## POWER BI FRONT-END VS BACK-END

Back-end including :
1. Connect & extract data using pre-build connectors
2. Profile & QA the data to explore, clean, and prepare it for modeling and analysis
3. Transform & shape tables to add new features, modify values, group records, or sort and filter columns
4. Merge or append queries to join and combine them prior to the front-end
5. Perform advanced transformations using custom M code

Front-end including :
1. Build data models by creating table relationships between primary and foreign keys
2. Add calculated measures & columns using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
3. Design reports to visualize the data and create interactive, dynamic dashboards.
4. Publish & share your Power BI workbooks using Power BI Service (cloud application)
