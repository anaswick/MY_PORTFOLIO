# APPENDING QUERIES

**Appending** queries allows you to **combine** or **stack** tables sharing the exact same column structure and data types

In other word, we can call it **UNION** like we do in SQL.

*Here we're appending the **AdventureWorks Sales 2020** table to the **AdventureWorks Sales 2021** table, which is valid since they share identical table structures.

***NOTE** : Appending **adds rows** to an existing table/query.

**PRO TIP** : Use the **folder** option (Get Data > More > Folder) to **append all files within a specified folder** (assuming they share the same structure); as you add new files, simply refresh the query and they will automatically append !
