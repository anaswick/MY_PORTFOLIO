# DATA SOURCE SETTINGS
___

**Data source settings** allow you to manage existing data connections, file paths and permissions.

It will record exact file path and the exact file name. If anything changes about your file, if you rename it, if you move it, update permissions, a path location, or anything else,  that path won't automatically update within Power BI. 

So what we need to do is go to this settings and revised version of that file.
