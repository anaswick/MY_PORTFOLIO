By default, **all queries** will refresh when you use the **Refresh** command from the **Home** tab but you can customer the refresh option.

From the Query Editor, uncheck **include in report refresh** to exclude individual queries from the refresh.

### PRO TIP : Exclude queries from refresh that don't change often (like lookups or static data tables)
