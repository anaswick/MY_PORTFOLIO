# MERGING QUERIES
___
**Merging queries** allows you to **join tables** based on a common column (like a lookup in Excel).

In this case we're merging **sales data** table with the **product lookup** table, which share a common **product key** column.

**NOTE** : merging **adds columns** to an existing table / query

**IMPORTANT NOTE** <br>
**Just because you can merge tables, doesn't mean you should!**

In many cases, it's better to keep tables separate and define **relationships** between them in the data model

1. Merging queries : it means, you will add new column in the existing active table
2. Merging queries as new : it means, you will create a new table as a result of merging queries.

Merging queries step-by-step
