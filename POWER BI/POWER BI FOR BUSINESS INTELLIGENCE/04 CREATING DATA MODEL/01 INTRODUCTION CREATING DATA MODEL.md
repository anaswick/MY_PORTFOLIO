# CREATING A DATA MODEL

In this section we'll cover **foundational data modeling topics** like normalization, fact and dimension tables, primary and foreign keys, relationship cardinality and filter flow

## TOPICS WE'LL COVER
1. Data modeling 101
2. Normalization
3. Facts & dimensions
4. Primary & foreign keys
5. Cardinality
6. Filter flow
7. Common schemas
8. Hierarchies

## GOALS FOR THIS SECTION
- Understanding the basic principles of data modeling, including normalization, fact & dimension tables and common schemas
- Create table relationship using primary and foreign keys, and discuss different types of relationship cardinality
