## WHAT IS A DATA MODEL ?

This is not a model because :
- this is a collection of independent tables, which share no connections or relationships

This is all of the tables that we had loaded before, this is not a model yet

We will try to pivot it.<br?
When we use values and field from the same tables, it works just fine.

But when we try to use another field from another table / query, it will looks weird like this because there is no relationships between those two tables.
