# DATABASE NORMALIZATION

**Normalization** is the process of organizing the tables and columns in a relational database to reduce redundancy and preserve data integrity. It's commonly used to :
- **Eliminate redundant data** to decrease table sizes and improve processing speed & efficiency
- **Minimize errors and anomalies** from data modifications (inserting, updating, or deleting records)
- **Simplify queries** and structure the database for meaningful analysis

In a normalize database, each table should serve a **distinct** and **specific** purpose (*e.g. product information, transaction records, customer attributes, store details, etc.*)
