# RELATIONSHIPS VS MERGED TABLES

Can't I just merge queries or use lookup functions to **pull everything into one single tables ?**

Yes you can, **but it's extremely inefficient!**
- merging tables create **redundancy** and often requires **significantly more memory and processing power** to analyze compared to a relational model with multiple small tables.

**AND IT'S COMPOUNDING, THE BIGGER THE DATA, THE MORE RESOURCES YOU WASTE**
