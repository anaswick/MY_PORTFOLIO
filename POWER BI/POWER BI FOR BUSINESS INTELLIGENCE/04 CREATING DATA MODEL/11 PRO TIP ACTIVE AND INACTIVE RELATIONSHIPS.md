The **Sales Data** table contains two date fields (**Order Date & Stock Date**), but there can only be **one active relationship** to the Date key in the Calendar table.

There are two ways to set whether a relationship become active or inactive

Double click the relationship. You can set relationships to active or inactive from either the **Edit Relationships** dialog box or the **Properties** (you must deactivate one before activating another)
