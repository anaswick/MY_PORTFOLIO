# Hello

Hello, my name is Anas Wicaksono. I am a data analyst currently working for one of the largest telecommunications and digital service companies in Indonesia. I enjoy diving into data to uncover hidden facts and trends with the goal of solving everyday problems and business challenges. Although I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics with a focus on management, I am always willing and continuously learning new things, including programming for data analytics. Feel free to use anything from my repositories and let's learn and grow together.
