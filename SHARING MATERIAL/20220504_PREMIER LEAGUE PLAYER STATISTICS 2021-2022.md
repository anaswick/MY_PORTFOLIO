# PREMIER LEAGUE PLAYER STATISTICS 2021-2022

Hello guys ! âš½
As a part of my data science learning journey , I am going to share what I've made using Tableau.

1. Most players in the league are from England, as teams are required to have at least 8 home-grown players out of 25 registered players based on Football Association Law.
2. Despite penalty kicks being considered easy, the success rate in the 2021/2022 season was only 81.55%, resulting in 1 out of every 5 penalty kicks failing.
3. The 36-year-old age group has the highest average goals scored, primarily due to Cristiano Ronaldo's outstanding performance, scoring 18 goals in the season. However, this group only has five players.

The data provides ample opportunities for further analysis. If you have any suggestions, criticisms, or tips, including Tableau techniques and life hacks, please share them.

I want to analyze my favorite team's performance, but this season has been the worst for me as a Chelsea F.C. fan. Haha. ðŸ¤£ But still
KEEP THE BLUE FLAG FLYING HIGH !

Happy weekend guys !
