Hello everyone! 😄

Today, I would like to share my experience in analyzing customer complaint data. There are many ways to approach this task, but first, let's discuss why it is important to analyze customer complaints in the first place.

1.   Identify areas for improvement: Customer complaints can provide valuable insights into the most frequent issues or pain points experienced by customers. Analyzing this type of data can help businesses improve and meet their customers' needs. ✨
2.   Trend analysis: Analyzing customer complaints can help identify patterns and trends that can be used to anticipate and proactively address issues before they become widespread. 😡
3.   Competitive analysis: By analyzing customer complaints, we can also compare our customer service and product performance with that of our competitors. 🌍

So, what insights can we gain from analyzing customer complaint data?

1.   📊Total number of tickets per period (day, week, month, year, quarter)
2.   💬 Number of tickets based on category (payment, shipping, invoice, etc.), and the top three categories with the most tickets.
3.   💢 Number of repeat complaints.
4.   😈 Ratio of tickets to active users.
5.   ⌚ Average ticket resolution time (by product, category, etc.).

Lastly, don't forget about Pareto analysis. Sometimes, most of the tickets come from specific issues and a small number of users. By addressing the main issues with least effort, we can solve 80% of our problems.

Is there anything we can analyze from customer complaint data ?

Please feel free to discuss so we can learn and grow together. Cheers!
