# Analyzing Customer Complaint Datasets : Insights and Benefits

Greetings everyone!

I would like to share my experience in analyzing customer complaint data for digital products, specifically web and mobile applications. As a seasoned data analyst, I have handled such data in the past when I managed an operational area that involved handling customer complaints.

Customer complaint data provides valuable insights even for small datasets. Recently, I analyzed data containing about 20k rows per month with fields such as Case Number/Ticket Number, Ticket Created Date, Ticket Closed Date, User ID, Application Name, and Ticket Symptom.

By manipulating variables, such as ticket date into ticket day, we can determine the busiest day in terms of the number of tickets, or count the differences between ticket closed date and ticket created date, which becomes the resolution time. Reclassifying some ticket categories can also provide useful information

So, what kind of insight I got from this data. Okay, let me break it down !

## Number of Tickets
I gained various insights from the data, including the number of tickets, user IDs, the busiest day and hour, the average resolution time, and the ticket symptom. The number of tickets broken down based on created date, closed date, user ID, application name, and ticket symptom provides a basic sense of where the tickets are mainly generated from.

## Number of User ID
Analyzing unique user IDs is crucial because it identifies repeat complainers. By tracking the number of unique users who experienced a particular issue, businesses can identify patterns and prioritize which issues to address first, allocate resources effectively, and develop targeted solutions. Monitoring unique user IDs can also help businesses assess customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Busy Day and Hour
Analyzing busy days and hours helps optimize staffing levels, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer experience. By knowing the peak hours and days of the week, businesses can allocate their resources effectively, ensuring they have enough staff available to meet customer demand during busy periods while avoiding unnecessary expenses during slower times.

## Average Resolution Time
Measuring average resolution time is vital because it evaluates the performance of assurance and product teams. Faster resolution time leads to improved customer satisfaction, reduced costs, and improved efficiency and profitability.

## Ticket Symptom
First, it can help identify the root causes of problems that are causing customer dissatisfaction. By categorizing and analyzing the various symptoms described in customer complaint tickets, businesses can determine which issues are most prevalent and address them more effectively. This can improve the overall customer experience, reduce customer churn, and enhance brand reputation.

Second, analyzing customer complaint ticket symptoms can also help identify areas for improvement in products or services. By identifying recurring symptoms, businesses can develop targeted solutions to address specific pain points and enhance their offerings. This can help businesses stay competitive in their industry and attract and retain customers.

Finally, analyzing customer complaint ticket symptoms can help businesses improve their operational efficiency. By categorizing and tracking customer complaints, businesses can identify areas where processes can be streamlined and optimized to reduce the number of complaints over time. This can help businesses save time and resources, while also improving the overall customer experience

## Finale
I thoroughly enjoyed analyzing customer complaint data as it provided me with valuable insights into our companyâ€™s products and their performance. This enabled me to provide comprehensive analyses and recommendations that would benefit the company. If you have any suggestions on how to leverage this data for the greater good, I am open to discussion. Thank you all for your attention.
